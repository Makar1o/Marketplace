# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Marketplace

A full-stack multi-tenant e-commerce platform (Gumroad-style) where vendors can create their own storefronts, sell digital products, and get paid through **Stripe Connect**.  
Built with **Next.js 15, Payload CMS, Stripe Connect, MongoDB, TailwindCSS v4, and ShadcnUI**.  

👉 **Live Demo**: [finess-gamma.vercel.app](https://finess-gamma.vercel.app/)

⚠️ **Note**: The project works perfectly in local development, but I am still fixing some issues on the deployed version.
